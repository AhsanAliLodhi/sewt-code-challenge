## This project tackles the problem of Object Localization for the Towel Data Set

### Prerequisites
[1] pandas
[2] numpy
[3] pytorch and torchvision
[4] skimage
[5] tqdm
[6] imgaug (https://github.com/aleju/imgaug)

### Here I explain the steps to run the whole experiment.

[1] Images provided to me by Sewt go in `data/test` folder.
[2] We run `python augmentor.py`, this makes augmented images and puts the new images in `data/train` along with the labels in `data/train/BB_labels.txt`. The augmentations are randomized and the scheme resides in `augmentor.py line 20 - line 110`. You can also specify `-n` or `--copies_per_image` as any integer greater than 0. A `-n 10` means one image in `data/test` will be augmented 10 times and hence the size of final dataset will be 10 times the size of `data/test`. Refer to `python augmentor.py --help` for more configurable settings.
[3] Now, we run following.
    [] `python feature_extractor.py -i data/test -b data/test/BB_labels.txt -o data/test/features.pkl`
    [] `python feature_extractor.py -i data/train -b data/train/BB_labels.txt -o data/train/features.pkl`
    This compresses each image into a vector of 1 x 2048, where this vector is a result of the forward pass from a pretrained resnet152. The result is stored in `data/train/features.pkl` and `data/test/features.pkl` respectively.
[4] After extracting features, we use them to train a configurable feed forward network. This network tries to regress the bounding boxes for images. (Note: The bounding boxes at this point are normalized to be between 0 and 1). We train by executing following `python train.py`. The structure of network and other parameters can be confgiured, please refer to `python train.py --help`. The model is then stored in `trained_ffn.pkl` in the root direcotry.
[5] Finally we use the model produced in step[4] and use it to evaluate predictions for images in data/test, we also compare it with the actual bounding boxes and display final MSE. We do so using `python test.py` (Note: Please make sure to always use the same settings to model structure in step [4] and this step to ensure correct loading of the model).

### Remarks

I realize there are better stratigies to solve the problem of image localization such as yolov3, however in this specific solution I intend to demonstrate my understanding of the problem, clean and structured code with extendible and reusable modules. This whle project follows pythoncodestyle guidelines.

PS. I am writing this read me while suffering from migrane, please mind the mistakes.
